cull images older than 3--5 years
- find better way of storing these photographs
- better way to access photos
- eg. commencement photos = 800 photos and are unnecessary

to do
- get single zip file and data file to see what we can extract
- dump all photographs into better archive
- for marketing we can pull out photos from the past 3 years
- extract categorical information
- look into copyright
- preservade (??)

- make script that extracts older files into separate directory

solution
- preservacode (???)
    - public facing interface

copyright status?
- does school have the rights to the photos
- except for photos of students, which may need to be restricted
    - melissa will need to look into

are the photos tagged or categorized in any way?
- well categorized
- tags were added to the photos

what kinds of photos
- staff photos, headshots
- classroom and student photos
- events
- campus beauty shots

we may need to do some manual sorting as well
- separate into historical significance VERSUS marketing

q what do we want to do with these photos?

q preservade?

q how to decide which photographs to keep
